## Goals and Overview
In this project, I was given multiple datasets
* /zippedData/tmdb.movies.csv
* /zippedData/imdb.title.crew.csv
* /zippedData/tn.movie_budgets.csv
* /zippedData/imdb.title.ratings.csv
* /zippedData/imdb.name.basics.csv
* /zippedData/imdb.title.principals.csv
* /zippedData/imdb.title.akas.csv
* /zippedData/bom.movie_gross.csv
* /zippedData/imdb.title.basics.csv

The goal of this project is to find at least 5 insights in this data by joining tables in creative and fun ways (but also useful ways).  


## Q1: Is there any pattern in the cast of the top 5 highest profitable movies?
(Extended question): Is there any relationship between genres?

# Exploration (EDA)
In the image below, we can see that the top highest grossing movies when compared to their production budget movies are: 
* Avatar 
* Titanic
* Avengers: Infinity War
* Star Wars Ep. VII: The Force Awakens
* Jurassic World

I decided to look at the distribution of **genres** across the **top 50** movies
